# HPiper
This is a small tool, in the style of Pyed Piper, or Pythonpy, designed to allow for using Haskell as a replacement for common command line tools such as Sed, Awk etc.

## TODO:

	- Enable call time module loading - currently only supports "baked in" modules
	- Enable persistent state of functions and loaded modules. Currently has no mechanism for defining further functions.
	- Find a more elegant solution to the escaped double quotes problem.
	- Update the cabal files to reflect actual dependencies
